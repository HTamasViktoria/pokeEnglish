## About The Project

PokeEnglish is designed to support parents in helping their children learn English vocabulary in a fun and interactive way. The app allows parents (or admins) to input vocabulary lists and assign Pokémon as rewards. Children can then practice these words, receive motivational messages, and collect virtual Pokémon when they master a list. These Pokémon can be used to "battle" against opponents, adding a game-like element to language learning.

### Key Features

- **Vocabulary List Management:** Parents can create and manage word lists for their children to practice.
- **Pokémon Rewards:** Children earn virtual Pokémon for mastering vocabulary lists, motivating them to learn.
- **Custom Messages:** Parents can leave encouraging or congratulatory messages that appear in the child's feed.
- **Practice Focus:** Parents can specify which vocabulary topics their child should focus on.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Children can use their earned Pokémon to engage in virtual battles.
